# TheWrestler
A new character for Slay the Spire

This character is flavored with two things in mind: A luchador, and a Warlock with mind-bending powers.

The main mechanics of the character include:
* **Grapple**: Grappling enemies enables other cards to grow in power
* **Combo**: Cards with the Combo keyword increase the character's combo power, giving successively greater benefits
* **Psychic Damage**: An alternate form of damage that ignores block, but doesn't scale with strength. It does benefit from the vulnerable condition and is reduced by the weak condition
* **Compelled**: Applying the Compelled power to enemies causes them to give themselves nerfs or give you buffs, or even damage themselves, depending on the enemy's intent
* **Devoid**: Some of the Wrestler's most powerful cards shuffle a Void card into the draw pile, a severe disadvantage, but one that can be exploited to powerful effect

## Roadmap

The overall character mechanics are not set in stone, and further testing is needed to balance and flavor the class. However, the biggest hurdle is the artwork, which is slow going.
