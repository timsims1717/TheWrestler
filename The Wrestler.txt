Wrestler:
Psychic Wrestler, Psychic powers are boosted when on a Grappled character, Fighter + GOO Warlock
Grapple
	Doesn't actually do anything on its own, but most cards will interact with the grappled target, or will buff you if there is a target grappled.
	Grapple counts down by 1.

Themes:
Wide Grapple vs Deep Grapple
Weak & str down (Psychic) vs Vuln & dex up (Wrestle)
Status Cards:
	Void
Void being a good thing (in certain situations)
Scaling Block through str down (enemy), dex up (self)
Scaling Damage through grapple, str up (self), reflecting damage

Keywords:
	Devoid: When you play this card, shuffle a void into your draw pile.
Wrestler Ideas:
	Grapple: Duration debuff on enemies (no benefit by itself)
	Combo: Implement a combo counter:
		Damage = 1 point
		Playing a card = 1 point
		Every 5 cards played = increased multiplier
		First turn bonus
		Take damage (except from cards) breaks the combo
		Graded based on points (S, A, B, C ...)
		Earn coins based on grade
		Earn Relics if get S?
Eldritch Ideas:
	Psychic Damage: Ignores block, but doesn't scale with Strength
	Fickle: At the start of combat, randomizes the values of the card (between -1 and +1 of original value)
	Compelled: The next time the enemy attacks, they damage themselves.
	Abominations:
		Special enemies that show up in certain circumstances
		Card that infects an enemy, and if they die from the infection, they turn into an abomination

Grapple changed to a "Condition":
	Condition is a stance for an enemy. Maybe get two or three on the Wrestler.
	Another condition could be a "Hunter's Mark" for the other character idea I have.
	Grapple would still be "only one enemy at a time" (w/o Agility Training)
	The enemy escapes the Grapple if you don't Grapple the enemy that turn.
